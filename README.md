## An Application Singleton
  - Manages global state
  - Uses a redux store

## A Better BrowserWindow Experience
  - Decorates windows with `electron-positioner`
  - Allows for specifying window sizes as percentages
  - Presets for certain types of windows

## Better IPC through streams and promises
  - Communicate between the renderer and main promises with `ask` and `tell`
  - Easily pipe streams between the renderer and main processes

## Write your electron windows as React components
  - React components render in the main process
  - Window positioning / sizing etc based on the react component state
  - Electron process React component children

# React Application Components for Electron

```js
